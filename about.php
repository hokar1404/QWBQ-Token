  <h1>About Quazenthor (QWBQ)</h1>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Why This Token Exists</h2>
    <p>QWBQ was created as a minimal, transparent BEP-20 reference contract on BNB Smart Chain mainnet for educational purposes only. It demonstrates standard token mechanics without any financial promises.</p>
    <p>It exists as a technical reference implementation — not as a financial or speculative product.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Who Benefits From It</h2>
    <p>QWBQ is intended for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students learning smart contract fundamentals</li>
      <li>Developers studying BEP-20 token mechanics</li>
      <li>Blockchain researchers analyzing on-chain behavior</li>
      <li>Technical reviewers examining immutable contract design</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is not designed for traders or speculative investors.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How It Is Used</h2>
    <p>Users interact with QWBQ directly on mainnet by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sending token transfers between wallets</li>
      <li>Testing approval and allowance mechanisms</li>
      <li>Monitoring Transfer and Approval event logs</li>
      <li>Observing holder distribution changes</li>
      <li>Verifying the permanently fixed total supply</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>For What Purpose It Is Used</h2>
    <p>QWBQ is used to demonstrate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real gas consumption</li>
      <li>Real transaction confirmation</li>
      <li>Immutable ledger recording</li>
      <li>Standard BEP-20 event emission</li>
      <li>Fixed supply contract behavior</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Exact Educational Role</h2>
    <p>The educational role of QWBQ is to serve as a live reference model of a minimal BEP-20 contract on mainnet.</p>
    <p>Unlike simulated environments, QWBQ allows learners to observe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How supply remains constant</li>
      <li>How allowances are granted and reduced</li>
      <li>How events are emitted and recorded</li>
      <li>How holder distribution evolves</li>
      <li>How gas behaves in real network conditions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Tokens Reach Users</h2>
    <p>QWBQ tokens are distributed manually upon request for educational interaction.</p>
    <p>There is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No ICO</li>
      <li>No presale</li>
      <li>No public sale</li>
      <li>No liquidity pool</li>
      <li>No exchange listing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Distribution is gradual and visible on-chain.</p>

    <h2>Contributors</h2>
    <p>The project is initiated and coordinated by the Founder.</p>
    <p>Independent contributors assist in documentation, technical review, and website maintenance.</p>
    <p>Contract ownership remains under the deployer address to preserve reference stability.</p>
    <p>None of the contributors have control over the contract logic or token supply.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Ownership Verification – BscScan Verified Signature</h2>
    <p>For transparency, the contract ownership has been publicly verified through a signed message on BscScan.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verified Signature ID:</strong> #15181</li>
      <li><strong>Deployer / Owner Address:</strong> 0x0daeb75bf06b879164d0753fa9d695763fcd1f49</li>
      <li><strong>View on BscScan:</strong> <a href="https://bscscan.com/verifySig/15181" target="_blank">https://bscscan.com/verifySig/15181</a></li>
      <li><strong>Status:</strong> Verified</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This verification confirms full ownership and accountability. The contract contains no owner-accessible modification functions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Smart Contract Functions Summary</h2>
    <p>The smart contract implements only standard BEP-20 functions: transfer, transferFrom, approve, allowance, balanceOf, totalSupply, name, symbol, decimals. No custom functions, no administrative controls, and no privileged roles exist.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Risk Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Interacting with blockchain tokens involves inherent risks, including smart contract behavior, network conditions, and user error. The project assumes no responsibility for user actions.</p>
