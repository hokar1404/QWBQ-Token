# QWBQ (Quazenthor)

Official Technical Reference Repository

## Project Owner / Founder Bio
**toora dokht** is the visionary founder, owner, and primary coordinator of the Quazenthor (QWBQ) project. Driven by a deep passion for democratizing blockchain technology and bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, she embarked on this initiative with a singular intent: to create an accessible, real-world educational tool that empowers learners worldwide. With her extensive expertise in blockchain development, smart contract deployment, and on-chain mechanics, toora dokht designed QWBQ as a transparent, immutable BEP-20 reference token on the BNB Smart Chain mainnet. Her core motivation stems from a belief that true understanding comes from hands-on interaction in a live environment, free from financial pressures or speculative distractions. By ensuring manual, gradual distribution solely for educational purposes, she aims to foster a community of informed developers, students, and researchers who can explore blockchain fundamentals without commercial influences. As the deployer, she upholds the project's integrity, coordinating independent contributors for documentation and reviews while steadfastly preserving its non-financial, purely educational scope. Her ultimate goal is to inspire innovation and ethical blockchain practices, making complex concepts approachable and verifiable for all.

## Project Overview

**Quazenthor (QWBQ)** is a fixed-supply educational BEP-20 token on BNB Smart Chain mainnet for real blockchain interaction and study. Non-financial, no sale, no investment. Total Supply: 5.00T QWBQ. Owner: toora dokht.

This repository serves as the official public reference hub for project documentation, transparency disclosures, and technical verification resources.

**Sector:** Education / Technical Reference

The project is a personal educational initiative to deploy a minimal, immutable BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain mainnet as a public reference for learning and technical study. It has no commercial intent, no fundraising mechanisms, no token sales, and no investment opportunities. It exists solely to demonstrate standard BEP-20 behavior in a live blockchain environment, allowing developers, students, and researchers to interact with real on-chain mechanics.

All project documentation, updates, and communications are managed by the founder or designated contributors under her coordination. The project remains fully transparent, with all on-chain activity publicly verifiable via BscScan.

## Why This Token Exists

QWBQ was created to provide a minimal and transparent BEP-20 reference contract deployed on BNB Smart Chain mainnet for real educational interaction.

The purpose of creating this token is to allow practical observation of how a fixed-supply BEP-20 contract behaves in a live blockchain environment.

It exists as a technical reference implementation — not as a financial or speculative product.

---

## Who Benefits From It

QWBQ is intended for:

- Students learning smart contract fundamentals  
- Developers studying BEP-20 token mechanics  
- Blockchain researchers analyzing on-chain behavior  
- Technical reviewers examining immutable contract design  

It is not designed for traders or speculative investors.

---

## How It Is Used

Users interact with QWBQ directly on mainnet by:

- Sending token transfers between wallets  
- Testing approval and allowance mechanisms  
- Monitoring Transfer and Approval event logs  
- Observing holder distribution changes  
- Verifying the permanently fixed total supply  

---

## For What Purpose It Is Used

QWBQ is used to demonstrate:

- Real gas consumption  
- Real transaction confirmation  
- Immutable ledger recording  
- Standard BEP-20 event emission  
- Fixed supply contract behavior  

---

## Exact Educational Role

The educational role of QWBQ is to serve as a live reference model of a minimal BEP-20 contract on mainnet.

Unlike simulated environments, QWBQ allows learners to observe:

- How supply remains constant  
- How allowances are granted and reduced  
- How events are emitted and recorded  
- How holder distribution evolves  
- How gas behaves in real network conditions  

QWBQ functions as a live on-chain educational reference for:

- Studying BEP-20 token mechanics  
- Observing Transfer and Approval events  
- Understanding allowance behavior  
- Monitoring holder distribution trends  
- Analyzing real gas usage on mainnet  
- Verifying fixed supply structure  

The project is designed strictly for technical and educational interaction.

Educational blockchain reference project • Non-financial • No token sale • No fundraising • No investment claims

## How Tokens Reach Users

QWBQ tokens are distributed manually upon request for educational interaction.

There is:

- No ICO  
- No presale  
- No public sale  
- No liquidity pool  
- No exchange listing  

Distribution is gradual and manual, with all changes transparently visible on the BNB Smart Chain. The initial supply is held by the deployer wallet for controlled release in educational contexts.

Recipients can:

- Perform transfers  
- Test Approval mechanisms  
- Analyze Event Logs  
- Observe holder distribution trends  

This distribution model is intentionally limited to maintain the token's role as a technical reference, not a financial or investment tool.

To request tokens for educational purposes (e.g., testing transfers, approvals), contact: [admin@quazenthor.com](mailto:admin@quazenthor.com). All communication is limited to educational and technical topics.

## Supply Structure Clarification

Total supply is permanently fixed at 5,000,000,000,000 QWBQ (5.00T). No minting, burning, taxation, or upgradeability exists. The supply was minted once at deployment and remains capped forever.

Educational distribution is gradual and manual, with all changes transparently visible on-chain.
