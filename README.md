Project Owner / Founder Bio
toora dokht is the founder, owner, and primary coordinator of the Quazenthor (QWBQ) project. With a strong background in blockchain development and smart contract deployment, she initiated this educational reference token to provide a transparent, immutable BEP-20 implementation on BNB Smart Chain mainnet. Her focus is on fostering real-world blockchain education through manual distribution for technical interactions, ensuring no financial or speculative elements. As the deployer, she maintains contract stability while overseeing gradual on-chain distribution for learners, developers, and researchers. She coordinates independent contributors for documentation and technical reviews, preserving the project's non-financial educational scope.

QUAZENTHOR (QWBQ)

A Live BEP-20 Educational Reference on BNB Smart Chain

WHAT IS QWBQ?

Quazenthor (QWBQ) is a fixed-supply BEP-20 token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain mainnet as a public technical reference implementation.

It enables real blockchain interaction using standard BEP-20 functions such as:

• Transfers
• Approvals
• Allowance validation
• Event log observation

The smart contract is verified and immutable.

WHY THIS TOKEN WAS CREATED

QWBQ was created to provide a minimal, transparent, and permanently fixed BEP-20 contract that allows real on-chain educational interaction.

Unlike testnet simulations, QWBQ operates on mainnet, enabling:

• Real gas consumption
• Real transaction confirmation
• Permanent ledger recording
• Observable holder distribution changes

It exists strictly as a technical blockchain reference, not as a financial instrument.

TOKEN STRUCTURE

• Network: BNB Smart Chain (Mainnet)
• Standard: BEP-20
• Total Supply: 5 Trillion QWBQ (Fixed Forever)
• No Minting
• No Burning
• No Taxation
• No Upgradeability

The contract logic cannot be modified.

HOW TOKENS ARE DISTRIBUTED

QWBQ tokens are distributed manually upon request for educational and technical interaction.

There is:

• No ICO
• No Presale
• No Public Sale
• No Liquidity Pool
• No Exchange Listing

Distribution is gradual and fully visible on-chain.

WHO BENEFITS FROM QWBQ?

• Blockchain students
• Smart contract learners
• BEP-20 developers
• On-chain behavior researchers
• Technical reviewers

QWBQ is designed for learning, testing, and observing — not trading or speculation.
